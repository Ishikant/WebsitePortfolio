          What really motivated me to pursue a career in software engineering is
          the opportunities and connections I can build in the field.
        </li>

        <li>
          I am a great team player and can take lead whenever needed, I
          understand that working together is the only way to make progress and
          it's why I try to build a strong connection with my coworkers.

          I have hobbies such as working on cars, playing soccer, swimming,
          hiking, fishing, reading, and going to the gym
        </li>

        <li>
          I appreciate other cultures because learning about how someone grew up
          in a different environment is very interesting. I love to talk about
          things that don't seem real or impossible feats.
